## üìù Schedule Input Formats

You can enter your schedule in two ways:

### 1. Text Format

Use a format like this:

```
08:00 AM ‚Äì 09:00 AM: Morning Routine
09:00 AM ‚Äì 11:00 AM: Deep Work
11:00 AM ‚Äì 11:30 AM: Break
11:30 AM ‚Äì 01:00 PM: Project Work
01:00 PM ‚Äì 02:00 PM: Lunch
02:00 PM ‚Äì 03:00 PM: Meetings
03:00 PM ‚Äì 05:00 PM: Learning / Study
05:00 PM ‚Äì 05:30 PM: Exercise
05:30 PM ‚Äì 06:00 PM: Review & Plan
06:00 PM ‚Äì 11:00 PM: Personal Time
11:00 PM: Sleep
```

- Each line defines a block: `Start Time ‚Äì End Time: Task Name`
- You can include any activity: study, work, meals, breaks, creative time, relaxation, sleep, etc.
- Times can be in 12-hour (AM/PM) or 24-hour format, according to your settings.

### 2. JSON Format

Alternatively, use a JSON array:

```json
[
  { "startTime": "08:00", "endTime": "09:00", "task": "Morning Routine" },
  { "startTime": "09:00", "endTime": "11:00", "task": "Deep Work" },
  ...
  { "startTime": "23:00", "task": "Sleep" }
]
```
